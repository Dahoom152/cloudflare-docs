# Debug Workers

Having visibility into issues, and being able to address them quickly is a critical part of developing an application. There are many tools to help identify issues in your Cloudflare Workers so you can respond appropriately.

## Debug locally

For local development, there is the Wrangler CLI. Running the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command, you can start a local server for developing your Worker. `wrangler dev` will run the preview of the Worker directly on your local machine using the open source Cloudflare Workers runtime, [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) and the Miniflare simulator.

Read more about this in our [local development and testing guide](/workers/learning/local-development-and-testing).

### DevTools

When running `wrangler dev`, you will see the following in your CLI:

```sh
------------------
wrangler dev now uses local mode by default, powered by ðŸ”¥ Miniflare and ðŸ‘· workerd.
To run an edge preview session for your Worker, use wrangler dev --remote

If you press `d` on your keyboard, a new DevTools session will open up so you can debug. Here, you can view console logs, view network requests, take memory snapshots, and see CPU usage.

In addition to the CLI, DevTools sessions are also available via the Workers Dashboard editor.

## Debug via logs

There are a variety of ways to get log messages from Workers, to view them, and to store them. Read the [Log from Workers guide](/workers/learning/log-from-workers) for detailed information.
